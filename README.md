# Game of Thrones

This Next JS App shows all the characters from tyhe series game of thrones. Also provides capability to perform filtering on the table. 
Currently the filtering will work on all columns(e.g. name, born, culture) with string values. We can add a custom filter fn to make it work for columns(e.g. titles, books) with array values.
